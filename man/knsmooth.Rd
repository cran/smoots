argument.}

\description{
This function estimates the nonparametric trend function in an equidistant
time series with Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression.
}
\details{
The trend or its derivatives are estimated based on the additive
nonparametric regression model for a time series

                     y_[t] = m(x_[t]) + eps_[t],

where y_[t] is the observed time series, x_[t] is the rescaled time on
[0, 1], m(x_[t]) is a smooth trend function and eps_[t] are stationary errors
with E(eps_[t]) = 0.

This function is part of the package \emph{smoots} and is used for
the estimation of trends in equidistant time series. The applied method
is a kernel regression with arbitrarily selectable second order
kernel, relative bandwidth and boundary method. Especially the chosen
bandwidth has a strong impact on the final result and has thus to be
selected carefully. This approach is not recommended by the authors of this
package.
